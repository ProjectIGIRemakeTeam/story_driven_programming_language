Story driven programming language. story->chatgpt->c++. In the previous video, we started to working on a new language which takes story first than it converts into smaller and smaller stories and these stories are translated into c++ code. We are working on a FPS game, we are creating the structure and the rules of the language. The purpose of the language is to help authors to write computer code through story telling technics. The story so far: <story> <engine src="unreal5" platform="macos" format="c++"> {/* This part describes the video game engine and the platform used to write the video game */} </engine> <plot type="FPS" number_of_playable_heros="2" offline_type="coop" online_type="all"> <desc>A First Person Shooter about two espionage agent. Co-op function up to 2 players, other online game modes.</desc> <plot_element playable="true"> Our hero finally reached the helicopter. It was a Black Hawk helicopter, painted in black with "U.S. Army" written in bold yellow letters on its side. As he got inside, the roar of the engines intensified and filled up the surroundings. Our hero took control of the chopper, and they took off towards their next mission.<plot_element> </plot> <player_input> <player_input>Playstation 4 Controller</player_input> <player_input>Playstation 5 Controller</player_input> <player_input>Xbox 360 Controller</player_input> <player_input>Xbox One Controller</player_input> <player_input>Xbox X Controller</player_input> <player_input>Joy-Con</player_input> <player_input>Keyboard and Mouse</player_input> </player_input> </story>
ChatGPT
Great to hear about your story-driven programming language project for creating a new FPS game. Let's continue to develop the language further through some suggestions below:

Game Mechanics
It would be helpful to have an additional element in the language that describes the mechanics of the game like weapon systems, movement, and interaction with the environment. This allows for the game developers to get an overview of how the game will function.

Here is an example code snippet using the new game mechanics feature:

Copy
Insert
New
<game_mechanics>
    <weapons>
        <weapon id="1">
            <name>Ak-47</name>
            <damage>200</damage>
            <range>20m</range>
            <ammo>30 rounds per clip</ammo>
        </weapon>
        <weapon id="2">
            <name>Sniper Rifle</name>
            <damage>500</damage>
            <range>100m</range>
            <ammo>10 rounds per clip</ammo>
        </weapon>
    </weapons>
    <movement>
        <movement_type>walking</movement_type>
        <movement_type>crouching</movement_type>
        <movement_type>running</movement_type>
        <movement_type>jogging</movement_type>
    </movement>
    <environment>
        <interaction>
            <interact_with_object>pick_up</interact_with_object>
            <interact_with_object>open</interact_with_object>
            <interact_with_object>close</interact_with_object>
            <interact_with_enemy>shoot</interact_with_enemy>
            <interact_with_enemy>punch</interact_with_enemy>
            <interact_with_enemy>stun</interact_with_enemy>
        </interaction>
    </environment>
</game_mechanics>
Non-playable Characters (NPC)
It would be beneficial to include non-playable characters (NPC) so that game developers can specify how these entities behave inside the game. This helps provide players with a more immersive and dynamic experience.

Here is an example code snippet on how to add an NPC in the language:

Copy
Insert
New
<npc>
    <npc_type>enemy</npc_type>
    <name>Henchman 1</name>
    <physical_attributes>
        <height>6ft 2in</height>
        <weight>190lbs</weight>
        <race>Caucasian</race>
        <hair_color>Brown</hair_color>
        <eye_color>Blue</eye_color>
    </physical_attributes>
    <behavioral_attributes>
        <primary_trait>angry</primary_trait>
        <secondary_trait>cruel</secondary_trait>
        <tertiary_trait>tactless</tertiary_trait>
    </behavioral_attributes>
</npc>
By adding NPCs, developers can provide a more compelling experience by making the game world feel realistic and vibrant.

Conclusion
Incorporating these elements into the language can help game developers create games quickly and efficiently with a story-driven approach. Remember, we're working towards coding via storytelling techniques. These additions make the process simpler and can speed up development without sacrificing creativity or depth in the game.



Second we can add plot_story, which describe a situation within the story. For example, Our hero(the one the player controls) have a mission on an airbase. (this will describe, who does, when, what, where) -> this is the level, where the plot of the story happens. <story> <engine src="unreal5" platform="macos" format="c++"> {/* This part describes the video game engine and the platform used to write the video game */} </engine> <plot type="FPS" number_of_playable_heros="2" offline_type="coop" online_type="all"> <desc>A First Person Shooter about two espionage agent. Co-op function up to 2 players, other online game modes.</desc> <plot_element playable="true"> Our hero finally reached the helicopter. It was a Black Hawk helicopter, painted in black with "U.S. Army" written in bold yellow letters on its side. As he got inside, the roar of the engines intensified and filled up the surroundings. Our hero took control of the chopper, and they took off towards their next mission.<plot_element> <plot_story>Our hero have a mission on an airbase. </plot_story> <plot_story>Our hero have a mission on a trainyard. </plot_story> </plot> <player_input> <player_input>Playstation 4 Controller</player_input> <player_input>Playstation 5 Controller</player_input> <player_input>Xbox 360 Controller</player_input> <player_input>Xbox One Controller</player_input> <player_input>Xbox X Controller</player_input> <player_input>Joy-Con</player_input> <player_input>Keyboard and Mouse</player_input> </player_input> </story>
ChatGPT
That's a great addition to the story! Adding plot_story elements can provide more context and specific details to the game's narrative, which can help the players immerse in the game world better. Here's an updated version of the story with the plot element:

Copy
Insert
New
<story>
    <engine src="unreal5" platform="macos" format="c++">

        <desc>A First Person Shooter about two espionage agents. Co-op function up to 2 players, other online game modes.</desc>
        <plot_element playable="true">Our hero finally reached the helicopter. It was a Black Hawk helicopter, painted in black with "U.S. Army" written in bold yellow letters on its side.

    </plot>

        <input_device>Playstation 5 Controller</input_device>
        <input_device>Xbox 360 Controller</input_device>
        <input_device>Xbox One Controller</input_device>
        <input_device>Xbox X Controller</input_device>
        <input_device>Joy-Con</input_device>
        <input_device>Keyboard and Mouse</input_device>
    </player_input>
</story>
I also made some minor improvements to the story by fixing some typos and inconsistencies. For example, I changed "number_of_playable_heros" to "number_of_playable_heroes" for consistency and clarity, and I changed "" to "" for more accurate labeling.

Alright. Creating a plot_story always has to describe the map/location/stage/level. From this every level will has an equalivent c++ code
ChatGPT
Yes, that is correct. Each plot_story will correspond to a specific level in the game, and these levels will have their own C++ code generated based on the story elements described within the plot_story.

For example, an "airbase" level could be described with details such as layout of the base, objectives to complete, enemies to defeat, weapons available, etc. These details would then be converted into C++ code that generates the actual game environment and gameplay mechanics for that level.

The beauty of this approach is that it allows game designers and developers to more easily create complex game environments by first designing them as a story, without having to worry about the technical implementation details upfront.

Let's create the basic file for the plot_story in c++. use informative descriptions, and tags selected. <plot_story>Our hero has a mission on an airbase. He needs to infiltrate the base and hack into the mainframe to gather important intel on the enemy's operation.</plot_story> tags like: #hero, mission, arbase etc. also name the functions, for example in the text there is a reference of hacking into, ergo there has to be a function which allows the hero to hack into. Also that means, this has to change the player-input-controller, because it has to be triggered by a player's input
ChatGPT
Sure, let's create a C++ code file for this plot_story. We can use object-oriented programming to represent the different entities in the game such as the hero and the airbase. Here is an example implementation:

Copy

#include<iostream>

    }

    string getName() const { return name_; };
    int getHp() const { return hp_; };
    bool isAlive() const { return hp_ > 0; };
    bool shoot() {

            return true;
        } else {
            return false;

    void heal(int amount) { 
        if(hp_ + amount <= 100){
            hp_ += amount;

class Game {

    void run() {
        level_->print();

            input->update(); // update using each controller
        }
        if(hero_->isAlive()) {
            cout << "Mission successful!" << endl;

        }
    }
    void setLevel(BaseLevel* level) {
        level_ = level;

    void executeMission() {
        if(hero_->shoot()) {
            cout << "Gotcha!" << endl;
        } else {

int main() {
    AirBaseLevel* air_base_level = new AirBaseLevel();
    Game fps_game;
    fps_game.setLevel(air_base_level);
    fps_game.run();
    fps_game.executeMission();
    delete air_base_level;

    return 0;
}
In this implementation, we have a Hero class that represents the playable character. The BaseLevel class and the AirBaseLevel derived class represent the different levels in the game. We also have a PlayerInput interface that defines the update() function, which will update all player inputs in the game.

The Game class is the main actor that sets up and runs the game. It creates a Hero object and a list of PlayerInput objects. It also holds a pointer to the current level and executes the mission logic when the



This is good, but I'd like to ask you to create the Map object. <plot_story>Our hero has a mission on a trainyard. He needs to secure a shipment of weapons before the enemy does and then extract safely.</plot_story> from this part has a mission on a trainyard, trainyard is a place for story element to happen. the mission is an action will be induced by the player, and the trainyard is the place of action. Our hero has a mission on a trainyard. From this sencence, the first c++ to be created not the mission itself, but the location. example: class level_trainyard { // every level has objects/actors on it. //1 thing is the size of the level, how big in sq2. is it a small room, a house, a city, a country, space etc }
    ChatGPT
    Agreed, creating the Map object is essential to give context and provide a foundation for the level. Here's how it could look like in C++:
    
    Copy
    Insert
    New
    class TrainYard {
    private:
        int size; // Size of the level in sq2.
        std::vector<Object> objects // All objects on this level.
    
    public:
        TrainYard(int size, std::vector<Object> objects) {
            this->size = size;
            this->objects = objects;
        }
        
        // Getters 
        int getSize() const { return size; }
        std::vector<Object> getObjects() const { return objects; }
    };
    Here, there's a TrainYard class that stores the size of the level in square units along with all the objects present in the level. The getSize() and getObjects() methods provide a way to access these values from outside the class - for example:
    
    Copy
    Insert
    New
    // Create a TrainYard object.
    std::vector<Object> trainyardObjects;
    int trainyardSize = 1000;
    TrainYard trainyard(trainyardSize, trainyardObjects);
    
    // Access the size and objects.
    std::cout << "TrainYard size: " << trainyard.getSize() << std::endl;
    std::cout << "Number of objects: " << trainyard.getObjects().size() << std::endl;
    This creates a TrainYard object with a size of 1000 square units and no objects, and then prints out its size and number of objects.
    
    With the TrainYard object created, we can now proceed to define the mission objectives within the specified location (trainyard) as well as functions and player controls necessary for them.



    You

Ok. The easier it is: When the author creates a story. <plot_story>Our hero has a mission on an airbase. He needs to infiltrate the base and hack into the mainframe to gather important intel on the enemy's operation.</plot_story> THIS PART: Our hero has a mission on an airbase. He needs to infiltrate the base and hack into the mainframe to gather important intel on the enemy's operation. Will be included into the new file as a <!-- This part describes the plot_story <plot_story>Our hero has a mission on a trainyard. He needs to secure a shipment of weapons before the enemy does and then extract safely.</plot_story> --> So we can follow how the story changes
ChatGPT
I see what you mean now. Here's an example template for the level_airbase class based on the description from the <plot_story> tag:

Copy
Insert
New
class level_airbase {
    public:
        // Some variables to store information about the level
        int width = 1000;
        int height = 1000;
        string name = "Airbase";
        
        void load_level() {
            // Load assets and objects specific to this level
        }
        
        void activate_mission() {
            // Set up the mission objectives, enemies, weapons, etc.
        }
};
And here's a similar template for the level_trainyard class:

Copy
Insert
New
class level_trainyard {
    public:
        // Some variables to store information about the level
        int width = 800;
        int height = 800;
        string name = "Trainyard";
        
        void load_level() {
            // Load assets and objects specific to this level
        }
        
        void activate_mission() {
            // Set up the mission objectives, enemies, weapons, etc.
        }
};
As the story progresses and new <plot_story> tags are added, more functions can be added to these classes to handle the specific requirements of those levels. For example, if the airbase level requires the player to hack into a mainframe, we could add a hack_mainframe() function to the level_airbase class.





You

class level_Trainyard { public: // Some variables to store information about the level int width = 800; int height = 800; string name = "Trainyard"; void load_level() { // Load assets and objects specific to this level } void activate_mission() { // Set up the mission objectives, enemies, weapons, etc. } }; class level_Airbase { public: // Some variables to store information about the level int width = 1000; int height = 1000; string name = "Airbase"; void load_level() { // Load assets and objects specific to this level } void activate_mission() { // Set up the mission objectives, enemies, weapons, etc. } }; <plot_story>Our hero has a mission on an airbase. He needs to infiltrate the base and hack into the mainframe to gather important intel on the enemy's operation.</plot_story> <plot_story>Our hero has a mission on a trainyard. He needs to secure a shipment of weapons before the enemy does and then extract safely.</plot_story> please insert the plot_story into the correct classes
ChatGPT
To insert the plot_stories into the correct classes, we can add them as member variables and update the activate_mission() function to reflect the mission objectives for each level. Here's an updated version of the code:

Copy
Insert
New
class LevelTrainyard {
public:
    // Some variables to store information about the level
    int width = 800;
    int height = 800;
    string name = "Trainyard";
    string mission = "secure a shipment of weapons before the enemy does and then extract safely.";
        
    void loadLevel() {
        // Load assets and objects specific to this level
    }
        
    void activateMission() {
        // Set up the mission objectives, enemies, weapons, etc.
        cout << "Mission objective: " << mission << endl;
    }
};


class LevelAirbase {
public:
    // Some variables to store information about the level
    int width = 1000;
    int height = 1000;
    string name = "Airbase";
    string mission = "infiltrate the base and hack into the mainframe to gather important intel on the enemy's operation.";
        
    void loadLevel() {
        // Load assets and objects specific to this level
    }
        
    void activateMission() {
        // Set up the mission objectives, enemies, weapons, etc.
        cout << "Mission objective: " << mission << endl;
    }
};

// Create instances of the levels
LevelTrainyard trainyard;
LevelAirbase airbase;

// Now we can access the mission descriptions for each level like this:
cout << "Trainyard mission: " << trainyard.mission << endl;
cout << "Airbase mission: " << airbase.mission << endl;

// And activate the mission objectives like this:
trainyard.activateMission();
airbase.activateMission();
With this code, we can keep track of the mission objectives for each level and activate them when necessary.

Now I adde this code: <plot_element enemy="true">Enemy helicopter brings soldiers on alarm</plot_element> -> this will create a new c++ class which desribes the new plot_element. An enemy helicopter <story> <engine src="unreal5" platform="macos" format="c++"> <!-- This part describes the video game engine and the platform used to write the video game --> </engine> <plot type="FPS" number_of_playable_heroes="2" offline_type="coop" online_type="all"> <desc>A First Person Shooter about two espionage agents.

Based on the added plot_element tag:

Copy
Insert
New
class EnemyHelicopter {
public:
    // Some variables to store information about the enemy helicopter
    int health = 100; #enemy,#airbase,#helicopter,#health
    int damage = 50; #enemy,#airbase,#helicopter,#damage
    string name = "Enemy helicopter"; #enemy,#airbase,#helicopter,#name

    void attack() {
        // Perform attack actions
    }

    void retreat() {
        // Retreat upon receiving damage
    }
};
The activateMission function of LevelAirbase class can make a use of this by adding an instance of EnemyHelicopter in one of its level's stages when the mission starts i.e.

Copy
Insert
New
void activateMission() {
    // Set up the mission objectives, enemies, weapons, etc.
    cout << "Mission objective: " << mission << endl;

    // Spawn enemy helicopter and soldiers
    EnemyHelicopter enemy_helicopter;
    vector<Soldier> soldiers;

    // Proceed with the mission
}
This way, we can add more dynamic elements to the mission in the Airbase level based on what we have described in the XML file.

I'm going to add a new plot type. plot menu. <plot_menu main="true"> Start menu with new game, select map, settings </plot_menu> <plot_menu ingame="true> Character is shown in Third Person View when the game is paused. </plot_menu> -> from this a c++ class created form each plot_menu
ChatGPT
Great, here are the C++ classes for the two plot_menu elements:

Copy
Insert
New
class PlotMenu_Main {
public:
    // Variables to store information about the main menu
    string title = "Game Menu"; // #plot_menu, #main_menu, #title
    vector<string> options = {"New Game", "Select Map", "Settings"}; // #plot_menu, #main_menu, #options
    
    void displayMenu() {
        // Display the main menu with its options
        cout << "===== " << title << " =====" << endl;
        for(int i=0; i<options.size(); i++) {
            cout << i+1 << ". " << options[i] << endl;
        }
    }
};

class PlotMenu_Ingame {
public:
    // Variables to store information about the ingame menu
    bool isPaused = false; // #plot_menu, #ingame_menu, #is_paused
    string characterViewMode = "Third Person View"; // #plot_menu, #ingame_menu, #view_mode
        
    void displayMenu() {
        // Display the ingame menu and its options
        if(isPaused) {
            cout << "===== In-Game Menu =====" << endl;
            cout << "Character View: " << characterViewMode << endl;
            // ...
        }
    }
};
You can use these C++ classes to implement the functionality of the plot_menu elements in your game.

IGI1 1 Trainyard The very first mission. Good Luck! And do not fret if you are not able to pass the very first mission, it simply takes a little more time time to grasp! Background Josef Priboi, a Russian arms dealer is kidnapped by the Russian Mafia for unknown reasons and is known to have sold them a nuclear warhead. He is kept at a Military Airfield according to intelligence. Breaking him out is necessary in order to get information about the location of the warhead, and prevent a nuclear disaster at the hands of the Russian mafia. However, the airfield at which he is held is protected by heavy anti-air SAM batteries, so direct air insertion isn't possible. In order to get close to SAM sites for their neutralization, Jones has to acquire a source of ground transportation from this coastline goods yard and then move onward to the SAM batteries. Briefing Anya: Good work getting here so fast. This mission has a top priority. Target; Josef Priboi. You are to locate him and bring him out for debriefing. Josef is our only link with the heist of the warhead. Jones: Yeah, yeah, I need to know one thing; Where he is. Anya: Josef is held at a military airfield. The whole area has excellent air defenses. We have to place you some distance from the target until those defenses are disabled. Jones: What! Is transport waiting? Anya: You'll cover the ground using locally resourced transportation assets. Jones: You mean I will have to steal something? Anya: Exactly. You will travel to the next goods yard. There, you will resource transportation. The whole operation is simple. There are three stages: One, acquire transportation assets. Two, disable air defenses. Three, find Josef Priboi and safely extract him for debriefing. Even... Jones: ....even a grunt like me can follow it. I see Anya: That's the best we have. Jones: Anya, just how did you track Josef down? Anya: We traced Josef's call to his apartment, right. Local agents raided it and found photos of Josef and his mobile number. So, we called it and triangulated the coordinates. The mobile's located at a military airfield. That's where Josef is. That's our primary target. Jones: Cunning. Assuming he's there. Anya: You must make your way through the goods yard to the truck. Avoid the cameras at all costs. If you alert the security, you'll have entire base zeroing in on your location. Get to the truck. This is your objective on this mission. Reach it and steal it. I want this mission to be brief and above all quiet. Get to work Jones! Objectives Steal the truck near the main entrance Weapons Knife: Given at the beginning of the mission Glock 17: Given at the beginning of the mission MP5SD3: Given at the beginning of the mission Uzi: Found in the small room of the security building AK47: Found on most of the guards Dragunov: Found on the water tower Minimi: Found in the large warehouse Hand Grenade: Found in the small warehouse close to the watchtower Medipack: Found in one of the three barracks near the watchtower Walkthrough For the walkthrough of this mission, click here.

Following the successful mission to steal the truck from the goods yard, Jones must now disable the heavy anti-air SAM batteries that protect the Military Airfield where Josef Priboi is being held. With no air insertion possible and the defenses posing a challenge, Jones must use his skills to approach and neutralize the batteries without alerting security. As he makes his way past enemy guards and weapons cache, Jones reflects on the gravity of his mission. The fate of thousands, if not millions, rests in his hands. Failure is not an option. With his heart racing and adrenaline pumping, Jones finally reaches the SAM site undetected. Carefully planting explosives, he waits for the right moment to detonate them and take out the defenses. The explosion rocks the area as Jones makes his way to the military airfield. He knows the next phase of his mission is crucial - locate Josef Priboi and extract him for debriefing. As he approaches the airfield, gunfire erupts, and Jones is forced to fight his way through heavily armed guards. But nothing can stop him from finding Josef and getting the information he needs to prevent a nuclear disaster. Jones remains focused, determined, and prepared to do whatever it takes to complete his mission.

In our story, we follow the adventures of two espionage agents in a first-person shooter video game with co-op function for up to 2 players and various online modes.

Our protagonist, David Jones, and his analyst Anya learn that a Russian arms dealer named Josef Priboi had been kidnapped by the Russian Mafia and imprisoned in a military airbase. They must rescue him to gather information about the location of a nuclear warhead sold to the Russians by Josef.

After rescuing Josef, he admits that his uncle Jach is selling the nuclear warhead to someone else. The players then capture the uncle, Jach Priboi, who admits to selling it to a Russian leader named EKK. David Jones gets orders to transport Jach to headquarters with a chopper, but the chopper gets shot down by Migs near the Russian border. EKK captures Jach and orders Jones to be killed, but Jones escapes across the border and is rescued by a chopper sent by Anya.

Jones and Jach escape by hijacking a train carrying Jach, but EKK derails the train. However, they manage to escape by another chopper sent by Anya. Jones gets orders to retrieve the warhead and terminate EKK. But when he finds the broken warhead used to make a nuclear bomb, he fails to kill EKK as she manages to escape again. Then Jones infiltrates the nuclear base where EKK planted the bomb. He kills EKK, and his analyst, Anya, defuses the bomb.

As the players progress through the game, they encounter various enemies, including helicopters bringing soldiers on alarm. Our hero uses a variety of weapons, including Glock 17, MP5SD3, Uzi, AK47, Dragunov, Minimi, hand grenades, and medipacks throughout the game.

The plot takes us through different locations such as an airbase where he needs to infiltrate the base and hack into the mainframe to gather important intel on the enemy's operation and a trainyard where he needs to secure a shipment of weapons before the enemy does and then extract safely.

Our hero, David Llewellyn Jones, is an I.G.I. agent and a former British Special Air Service operator. Anya is an experienced contact and mission director at headquarters who becomes his partner in their journey. Jach Priboi is a Soviet arms dealer, Ekk is a homicidal Russian woman, and Captain Harrison is the commander of allied troops and a former ex-Green Beret in the US Army Special Forces.

The players can use various input devices, including PlayStation 4 & 5 controllers, Xbox 360 & One controllers, Joy-Con, and keyboard & mouse to control the game characters.

Background

Josef Priboi, a Russian arms dealer has been kidnapped by the Russian Mafia for unknown reasons and is known to have sold them a nuclear warhead. It is crucial to break him out to acquire information about the location of the warhead and prevent a nuclear disaster at the hands of the Russian mafia. However, the airfield where he is held has heavy anti-air SAM batteries, making it impossible for direct air insertion. To neutralize the SAM sites and get close to Josef, Jones must acquire local transportation assets from a nearby goods yard and proceed towards the target.

Briefing

Anya informs Jones about the mission's high priority and assigns him the task of locating and extracting Josef for debriefing, as he is the only link with the warhead's heist. After an exchange, Anya reveals that Josef is being held at a military airfield and orders Jones to travel to the next goods yard to resourced transportation. The process includes three phases, which involve acquiring transportation assets, disabling air defenses, and safely extracting Josef for debriefing.

Here's the C++ file I created for each weapon:

Copy
Insert
New
class weapon_AK47 {
public:
    int damage = 200;
    float range = 20.0;
    int ammo_capacity = 30;

    void fire() {
        // Code to fire AK-47
    }

    void reload() {
        // Code to reload AK-47
    }
};

class weapon_RPG7 {
public:
    int damage = 1000;
    float range = 100.0;
    int ammo_capacity = 1;

    void fire() {
        // Code to fire RPG-7
    }

    void reload() {
        // Code to reload RPG-7
    }
};

class weapon_KRISSVector {
public:
    int damage = 300;
    float range = 15.0;
    int ammo_capacity = 25;

    void fire() {
        // Code to fire KRISS Vector
    }

    void reload() {
        // Code to reload KRISS Vector
    }
};

class weapon_DesertEagle {
public:
    int damage = 400;
    float range = 25.0;
    int ammo_capacity = 7;

    void fire() {
        // Code to fire Desert Eagle
    }

    void reload() {
        // Code to reload Desert Eagle
    }
};
Note that I created member variables for damage, range, and ammo_capacity, as well as methods for fire() and reload() for each weapon class. These can be further customized based on any game specifications or requirements.
