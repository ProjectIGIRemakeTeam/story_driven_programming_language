With this language, you can build your project's storyline parallelly alongside the code and visualize the end product while working simultaneously. To start creating a story, use the building block of . Without a story, there is nothing. You can create it by simply typing . The second building block is , which will decide what is the c++ output of your story. It varies based on the choice of Author. It can be, for example: "Unreal Engine", "Unity", "Xcode", "Android Studio", "CryEngine" etc. You can specify the engine in and describe the video game engine and the platform used to write the video game. The third building block is , which describes the whole program in a story-driven way. To create a plot, describe all story elements referring to what is going to happen on the screen. You can divide the plot into smaller stories using based on the first plot prompt. For example: if I type: My game is a single player FPS; I'll get . You can create menus using , which let authors create main/in-game menus. describes how the player interacts with the story, like Keyboard + mouse input or controllers, etc. Plot elements can be global or local/within a , effects, scenes, sounds, media, dialogues, actions, etc. is an actor in the story. The protagonists, antagonists, every playable/non-playable character(AI/NPC) is a plot_character. Each character opens up endless possibilities for storytellers as they can use them to communicate complex ideas more effectively. Plot helpers are global and serve as a sub-director of the author. handles mainly the AI actors' behaviors during plot_story. Finally, to put it all together, don't forget to use . It's a very important element of the story that answers who do what where with whom or what. This can refer to the map/level/stage, and without it, the action has no place to happen. For example, if you're making an FPS game with ten maps, each map will be a . That's it! I hope this helped you understand the language rules and how to create a story element. <story></story>: This is the building block of the language and it's used to start creating a story.

Once upon a time, in a world far away, there existed an ancient kingdom. A place filled with magic and wonder which was threatened by an evil sorcerer. The people of the land were living in fear as the wicked sorcerer had created powerful monsters that terrorized them. Desperate for help, the queen summoned a group of adventurers to defeat the sorcerer and save their kingdom.

The adventurers, who were known for their bravery, arrived at the kingdom promptly to face the sorcerer's wrath head-on. They ventured into the unknown terrain, exploring the land and gathering information to find the sorcerer. Soon they discovered he has been hiding in the forbidden castle, guarded by fierce monsters like dragons, trolls, and demons.

The journey was arduous, and the adventurers had to use all their skills and strategies to bypass the formidable traps set in their path. Along the way, they met friendly beings like pixies and centaurs, who helped them on their journey.

After overcoming many obstacles, the adventurers reached the castle's gates, but it was heavily guarded. They decided to split up, with one adventurer distracting the monsters, while others made their way inside stealthily.

Once inside, they explored the dark dungeons and fought their way through hordes of monsters looking for the evil sorcerer. Finally, they found him in his throne room, surrounded by his guards.

A fierce battle took place, and after what seemed like an eternity, the adventurers emerged victorious. The sorcerer was vanquished, and his hold over the kingdom lifted. The people of the land rejoiced their newfound freedom and thanked the brave adventurers who had saved them from certain doom.

And so, the kingdom lived happily ever after, with tales of the heroic adventurers passed down from generation to generation.

This code converts all of the story elements into their respective C++ syntax, which an experienced developer could then use to build a video game environment. Note that while this code is syntactically correct, it may not be feasible for writing an entire video game, as there are many more details and complexities involved in programming than what can reasonably fit in a single code sample.
