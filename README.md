Story-driven programming language
Story-driven programming language is a unique type of programming language that integrates a detailed and structured story into code-writing. It is called story-driven programming because it allows developers to build their project's storyline parallelly alongside the code, helping them to visualize the end product while working simultaneously.

This innovative approach to programming provides a more focused and intuitive way of working with a better understanding of the use case and desired outcomes. With this language, developers can tailor their code directly to specific needs within a broader context of the entire story or narrative.

The language allows for the inclusion of rich media or interactive elements such as music, images, and animations within the source code, making it more captivating than traditional dull code. Besides, it enables developers to create affective connections between character interactions, scenes, and conversations, adding depth to their work that would be challenging to achieve otherwise.

In summary, Story-driven programming language opens up endless possibilities for developers by enabling them to communicate complex ideas more effectively using storyboards/narratives as well as creating immersive and engaging products in the future.
